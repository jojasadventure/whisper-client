# Status Update: Whisper API Transcription App

We have successfully implemented several updates and improvements to the Whisper API Transcription App:

1. **Prompt Input**: Added a new text entry field allowing users to enter a prompt to guide the transcription process. The prompt is sent along with the audio data to the Whisper API to improve transcription accuracy.

2. **Window Size and Position**: Adjusted the window size and position to ensure that all UI components, including the new prompt input field, are visible without the need for manual resizing.

3. **Paste Functionality**: Addressed an issue where the paste functionality sometimes only pasted a single character. The application now correctly pastes the entire transcribed text into the active window.

4. **Graceful Exit**: Implemented a signal handler to gracefully quit the application when CTRL+C is pressed in the terminal. This ensures that all resources are properly released, and the application closes cleanly.

5. **Code Refactoring**: Refactored the codebase to improve readability and maintainability. This included fixing indentation issues and ensuring consistent formatting throughout the project.

6. **Documentation**: Updated the README.md file to reflect the new features and changes made to the application. The README now provides clear instructions for installation, usage, customization, and troubleshooting.

These updates have significantly enhanced the functionality and usability of the Whisper API Transcription App. Users can now provide prompts to improve transcription accuracy, enjoy a more streamlined user interface, and benefit from improved error handling and documentation.

We will continue to monitor the application's performance and gather user feedback to identify further opportunities for improvement and feature enhancements.
