# OpenAI Whisper API and Prompting Summary

## Overview of OpenAI API for Speech and Prompting

1. The OpenAI Whisper API provides endpoints for transcription and translation of audio.
2. Prompts can be used to improve transcription accuracy, especially for specific words or terms.
3. The API only considers the first 244 tokens of the prompt.
4. Prompts can help with correcting specific words, preserving context, and maintaining punctuation.

## Using the API with Python Requests

1. The API is accessed via HTTP POST requests.
2. Audio files are sent as multipart/form-data.
3. Additional parameters like 'model', 'language', and 'prompt' are included in the request.

### Key Code Snippet

```python
def upload_audio_to_whisper(self, file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
            files = {'file': ('audio.wav', audio_file, 'audio/wav')}
            data = {
                'model': 'Systran/faster-whisper-medium',
                'language': self.language_var.get(),
                'prompt': self.prompt_entry.get("1.0", tk.END).strip(),
            }
            print(f"Debug: Sending request to {self.api_url}")
            print(f"Debug: Request data: {data}")
            response = requests.post(self.api_url, files=files, data=data)

        # ... (response handling code)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Debug: Error during upload: {e}")
        return ''
```

## Testing Prompt Effectiveness

### Test Strategies

1. **Controlled Comparison**
   - Transcribe the same audio with and without a prompt.
   - Compare results for accuracy, especially with specific terms in the prompt.

2. **Intentional Misspellings**
   - Include misspelled words in audio.
   - Use correct spellings in prompt.
   - Check if transcription corrects misspellings.

3. **Domain-Specific Terminology**
   - Record audio with specialized terms or acronyms.
   - Include these terms in the prompt.
   - Verify accurate capture of these terms.

4. **Punctuation Test**
   - Record audio with minimal verbal punctuation cues.
   - Include punctuation in prompt.
   - Check for appropriate punctuation in transcription.

5. **Context Preservation**
   - For longer audio, use previous segment transcript as part of the prompt for the next segment.
   - Verify maintenance of context and coherence across segments.

6. **Language Style Test**
   - Record audio in specific dialect or accent.
   - Use a prompt reflecting this language style.
   - Check if transcription maintains appropriate style.

7. **Proper Noun Handling**
   - Include uncommon proper nouns in audio.
   - List these proper nouns in prompt.
   - Verify correct transcription.

### Implementing Tests

1. Create a set of test audio files with known content.
2. Develop a testing script for transcriptions with various prompts.
3. Implement a comparison function to evaluate transcription accuracy.
4. Log and analyze results to determine prompting effectiveness.

## Important Note

Remember that the Whisper API only considers the first 244 tokens of the prompt, limiting the amount of context or specialized vocabulary that can be provided in a single prompt.
